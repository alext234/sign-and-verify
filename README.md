# Signing and Verifying with Ethereum

This project demonstrate a simple example of signing a message locally (off-chain)
with the JSON RPC `eth_sign`. The signature can be verified by through a 
smart contract which makes uses of the Solidity's `ecrecover`  function.
 
The whole flow is implemented in the [test script](testnet_script.sh).
